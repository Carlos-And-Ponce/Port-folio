# my **PORT-FOLIO**

Hehehe well, How can I explain this...?

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/vmSvzbc/why-This-Design3.jpg" />

This was _""""""main""""""_ project in 2022 and well, I hate it now hahahaha, I've seen it for a long time and I don't want work more in it anymore, but I'm thinking in the desing to my next **_PORT-FOLIO_**

Nothing special, just the design, the code is very simple but the html structure is bit "weird" because hahaha safari in mac os catalina has a problem with **"mix-blend-mode: exclusion/difference"**. When I started the project, without nextjs, 1 month ago I move the project to nextjs because practiced the framework

Well I did write about it a long time ago on my **_<a href="https://ttager.page/p/port-folio" target="_blank">PORT-FOLIO</a>_**

The only thing I like is this image of it, it's literally is my face now lol.

If you're still wondering why I don't like this project, well <a href="https://ttager.page/resume/" target="_blank">_here's_</a> the problem... **the problem isn't doing that**, is something else...

I'm wirking in my next portfolio, with a great desgin and code, I will add 3d interaction for the content and transition, I'm excited these project.
